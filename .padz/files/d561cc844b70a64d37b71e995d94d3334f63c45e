proj readme


now that v1 is ready, we'll write an internal README.txt for the project.

guidelins: 
- no markdown, this is a plain text file.
- no emojis.
- this is not a ghithub marketing piece, this is a informal but informantional
  readme that explains the project to a new developer or contributor.
- you can assume very  senior engineers will read this, so you can use
  technical terms and jargon without explaining them,  and no need to go over
  DECLOUPING HAS THIS BENEFITS:.... they know it.
- create 

  1. Motiviation

  explain the use case, with a good example

  2. Design Decisions

  explain the architecture, the trade-offs (like  +3 levels deep we don't
  optimize the uuid generation, and it's fine)
  explain that, give then use case (small scale interactive apps on
  workstatison) we dont handle concurrecty, that's why sqllite is a good fit.

  3. Feature

  short run down of the lib's features


  4. The api

  (not a full api doc, jsut a high level example of how to user to say, a todo
  list with done and smart ids for users)

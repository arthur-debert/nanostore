test app for nanostore


with v1 of nanostore approaching, we want to verify that , alongside the uni
tests, that we can build a simple app that uses nanostore as its state
management with the features we want to use.


task create under test-apps/todo

a todo app to test nanostore
1. this is a test app, so no command line, no fluf, just the core basis

1. todos are nested (can have parend)
2. todos has body, status (done or pening)

# I'll do some pseudo code here: 

todo.add ("Groceries")
1. Groceries
todo.add( "Packing")
1. Groceries
2. Packing

todo.add("Buy milk", parent="Groceries")
todo.add("Buy eggs", parent="Groceries")
todo.add("Buy bread", parent="Groceries")
1. Groceries
   1.1. Buy milk
   1.2. Buy eggs
   1.3. Buy bread
2. Packing


(now we mark eggs as done)
todo.mark_done("Buy eggs")
todo.list(status=pening)
1. Groceries
   1.1. Buy milk
   1.2. Buy bread
2. Packing

todo.list(status=done)
1.d1. Buy eggs

todo.list(status=all)
1. Groceries
   1.1. Buy milk
   1.2. Buy bread
   1.d1 Buy eggs (done)
2. Packing

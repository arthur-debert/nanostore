b1 code review -all
 Here is my review of the nanostore codebase:

  High Priority

   * H1: Refactor to Eliminate `interface{}`: The most critical issue is the
     pervasive use of interface{} in the engine's public-facing methods (List,
     Update) and the storeAdapter. This completely undermines Go's type system,
     leading to fragile, error-prone code that relies on runtime type assertions.
       * Recommendation: The engine's methods should use the concrete types defined
         in nanostore/types.go (e.g., ListOptions, UpdateRequest, Document). The
         storeAdapter will then become a simple pass-through, and the ugly type
         assertions can be removed. This will improve type safety, readability, and
         performance.

   * H2: Unimplemented Filtering in `List`: The List function in the engine
     currently ignores all filtering options from ListOptions. The SQL query in
     list.sql is static and always returns all documents. This means a core piece
     of functionality is missing.
       * Recommendation: The List function needs to dynamically build the SQL query
         based on the ListOptions. This should be done carefully to avoid SQL
         injection vulnerabilities. Use query parameters (?) for all user-provided
         values. The list.sql file should be a template, or you should build the
         query in Go using a library like squirrel to safely construct the WHERE
         clause.

  Medium Priority

   * M1: Inefficient `ResolveUUID`: The ResolveUUID function makes a separate SQL
     query for each part of a hierarchical ID (e.g., "1.2.3" requires 3 queries).
     This is inefficient and will lead to performance problems as the hierarchy
     deepens.
       * Recommendation: This can be solved with a single, more complex recursive
         CTE query, similar to the one in list.sql. This would be a significant
         performance improvement.

   * M2: Lack of Transactional Integrity: The write operations (Add, Update,
     SetStatus) are not wrapped in transactions. While single queries are atomic in
     SQLite, more complex operations in the future might require transactions to
     ensure data consistency.
       * Recommendation: Wrap all write operations in transactions. This is a good
         practice for ensuring data integrity.

  Low Priority

   * L1: Redundant `storeAdapter`: The storeAdapter adds a layer of indirection
     without providing much value, especially if the interface{} issue is fixed.
     The engine could directly implement the Store interface.
       * Recommendation: Consider merging the storeAdapter and the engine.store.
         This would simplify the code. The public API can be exposed from the
         nanostore package, while the implementation resides in the internal/engine
         package.

   * L2: Missing `docs/dev/testing.txt`: The user mentioned a docs/dev/testing.txt
     file with testing guidelines, but I don't see it in the file tree.
       * Recommendation: If this file exists, I should review it to ensure the
         tests align with the guidelines. If it doesn't exist, this point can be
         ignored.

  Test Quality

  I haven't reviewed the tests yet. I will do that now to assess their quality
  and coverage. I'll start by listing the test files.I've reviewed the SQL and
  have a full codebase picture. My findings: High-priority issues are the
  dangerous interface{} usage and unimplemented List filtering. Medium-priority
  is the inefficient ResolveUUID and lack of transactions. Low-priority includes
  a redundant storeAdapter and a missing testing.txt file. I'll now review the
  tests for quality and coverage, starting with a file listing.

✦ I have reviewed the tests. Here's my assessment:

  Test Quality Assessment

  The test suite is extensive and covers a wide range of scenarios. This is
  excellent for a project at this stage.

   * Comprehensiveness: The tests cover basic CRUD, hierarchical structures, ID
     resolution, edge cases (empty/long titles, special characters), error
     handling, and even concurrency and benchmarks. This is very thorough.
   * Correctness: The tests appear to be correct and are validating the right
     things. They correctly check for expected outcomes and handle errors.
   * Design Quality: The tests are well-structured, with separate files for
     different areas of functionality. The use of t.Run for sub-tests is good
     practice. The benchmark tests are a great addition for performance tracking.
   * Adherence to Guidelines: Since I don't have docs/dev/testing.txt, I can't
     assess adherence to it. However, the tests follow common Go testing practices.

  Issues and Recommendations for Tests

   * T1: Skipped Concurrency Tests: The concurrency tests in concurrent_test.go are
     skipped. The reason given is that the in-memory SQLite database doesn't support
      concurrent connections.
       * Recommendation (Medium Priority): These tests are important for ensuring
         the library is safe for concurrent use. The tests should be enabled and
         run against a file-based database in a temporary directory, which is what
         the TestConcurrentReads test already does. This will provide a much
         stronger guarantee of correctness.

   * T2: Missing Tests for Filtering: There are no tests for the filtering
     functionality of the List method (e.g., FilterByStatus, FilterByParent,
     FilterBySearch). This is because the functionality itself is not implemented
     (see H2 in the code review).
       * Recommendation (High Priority): Once the filtering logic is implemented, a
         comprehensive set of tests should be written to cover all filtering
         scenarios.

   * T3: `TestManyDocuments` ID check is simplified: The test TestManyDocuments in
     edge_cases_test.go has a comment saying // This is simplified - real test 
     would handle multi-digit IDs properly. This means the test is not correctly
     validating the user-facing IDs for numbers greater than 9.
       * Recommendation (Low Priority): The ID generation logic in this test should
         be fixed to correctly handle multi-digit numbers, so it can properly
         validate the output.

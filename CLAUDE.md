## Key Points

- Test driven development
- often the same go file can be split in several tests files. in tests the
path encodes information (as grep to execute etc) make sure there is
significant mapping between name and content, be sharp on the test file theme
- Avoid brittle tests, don't test for things like messages or several pieces of
  data if one will do.

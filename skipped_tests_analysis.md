## Detailed Analysis

### Group A: Concurrent Operations

**Recommendation: KEEP SKIPPED**

These tests are skipped because:
1. SQLite has limited concurrent write support (database-level locking)
2. In-memory databases don't share data between connections
3. The tests document expected behavior but aren't critical for functionality

The non-skipped `TestConcurrentReads` shows that concurrent reads work fine. The skipped tests would fail due to SQLite limitations, not bugs in the code.

### Group B: Not Implemented Features

**Recommendation: REMOVE OR DOCUMENT DIFFERENTLY**

1. **`TestTransactionRollback`** - Remove. The test itself acknowledges transactions aren't exposed in the public API. This should be documented in design docs, not as a skipped test.

2. **`TestAtomicBatchOperations`** - Remove. This is a feature request, not a test. Should be tracked as a GitHub issue instead.

3. **`TestListAfterDeletion`** - Remove. Delete functionality isn't implemented. When/if delete is added, proper tests should be written then.

### Group C: Platform/Environment Dependent

**Recommendation: KEEP BUT IMPROVE**

1. **`TestReadOnlyDatabase`** - Keep skipped. The test correctly identifies that permission handling varies by OS. However, it could be improved to run on platforms where it works reliably.

2. **`TestNewWithReadOnlyDirectory`** - Keep as is. It already has conditional skip logic that attempts the test first.

### Performance/Resource Tests

**Recommendation: KEEP AS IS**

These tests use `testing.Short()` appropriately:
- They test resource exhaustion and performance characteristics
- They take significant time to run
- They're valuable for catching performance regressions
- The `testing.Short()` pattern is idiomatic Go

## Implementation Details Found

### Already Implemented Features:
1. **Circular reference detection** - `TestRollbackOnConstraintViolation` and other tests show foreign key constraints work
2. **Concurrent read operations** - `TestConcurrentReads` passes without skip
3. **Database recovery after crash** - `TestDatabaseConsistencyAfterPanic` verifies SQLite's built-in transaction rollback

### Not Implemented:
1. **Public transaction API** - Each operation is auto-committed
2. **Batch operations API** - No atomic multi-operation support
3. **Delete functionality** - No delete method exists

## Recommendations Summary

### Remove these tests:
1. `TestTransactionRollback` - Not a real test, just API documentation
2. `TestAtomicBatchOperations` - Feature request, not a test  
3. `TestListAfterDeletion` - Test for non-existent feature

### Keep these tests:
1. All concurrent write tests - Document SQLite limitations
2. Platform-dependent permission tests - Already have proper skip logic
3. All performance/resource tests - Valuable for regression testing

### Action Items:
1. Create GitHub issues for:
   - Transaction API enhancement
   - Batch operations feature
   - Delete functionality
2. Consider adding a `LIMITATIONS.md` file documenting SQLite's concurrent write limitations
3. The concurrent tests could be moved to a separate file with a clear comment block explaining why they're skipped

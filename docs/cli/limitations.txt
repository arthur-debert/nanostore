CLI Bulk Operations: What You Lose vs API

If you're comfortable with the nanostore API and wondering what you'll lose
by using the CLI bulk operations, here's the honest breakdown:

What you lose:

- Can't bypass the query parsing system (no complex objects, raw SQL, or arbitrary filter maps)
- Limited dry-run information

Bottom Line:

If you need to pass complex objects, use raw SQL, or bypass the query system,
stick with the API.

Examples:

API: store.UpdateWhere("priority >= ?", []interface{}{3}, map[string]interface{}{"status": "completed"})

CLI: nano-db update-where --sql --priority__gte=3 --data --status=completed

The CLI syntax is more verbose but structured.

# Notes App

A note-taking application that demonstrates nanostore's dynamic ID generation with status-based prefixes.

## Features

- **Two-state lifecycle**: live â†’ archived
- **Dynamic ID prefixes**:
  - Live notes: `1`, `2`, `3`...
  - Archived notes: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`...
- **Tagging system**: Organize notes with multiple tags
- **Search**: Search by content
- **Delete**: Hard delete removes notes completely

## Key Differences from Todo App

1. **Flat structure**: No hierarchical relationships (todo app has parent-child)
2. **Tag-based organization**: Uses tags stored in body instead of parent-child relationships
3. **Archive vs Complete**: Uses different terminology but same underlying status system
4. **Hard delete**: Delete removes items completely rather than soft delete

## Usage

### Building

```bash
cd cmd
go build -o notes
```

### Commands

```bash
# Add a note with tags
./notes add "Meeting notes" -c "Discussed project timeline" -t "work,meetings"

# List notes
./notes list
./notes list --archived  # Include archived notes

# Archive and unarchive
./notes archive 1
./notes unarchive c1

# Delete (permanent)
./notes delete 2

# Update tags
./notes tag 1 "work,important,followup"

# Search
./notes search "project"
./notes search "meeting" --archived
```

## ID Generation Examples

Starting with these notes:
```
1. Project ideas
2. Meeting notes
3. Shopping list
```

After archiving note 2:
```
1. Project ideas
2. Shopping list

Archived:
c1. Meeting notes
```

After deleting note 1:
```
1. Shopping list

Archived:
c1. Meeting notes
```

## Implementation Notes

### Status Configuration

The notes app uses nanostore's default configuration:
- Maps "live" notes to "pending" status (no prefix)
- Maps "archived" notes to "completed" status ("c" prefix)
- Delete operations remove documents entirely

### Tag Storage

Tags are stored in the `data` field as JSON, allowing flexible tag management without requiring additional database schema.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
go test -v
```

The tests cover:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Status transitions
- Pinning behavior
- Tag filtering
- Search functionality
- ID renumbering scenarios
